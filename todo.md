# Project TODO

- [x] Set up project structure and data file
- [x] Install p5.js and Tone.js dependencies
- [x] Create data structure from Google Sheets observations
- [x] Design dark ambient theme with warm-to-cool color palette
- [x] Implement interactive p5.js visualization with nodes
- [x] Add node color coding by age group (students=amber, middle-age=gold, older=blue)
- [x] Add node size based on number of people
- [x] Add glow intensity based on social engagement
- [x] Implement node movement and drift animation
- [x] Add fade-out effect for temporal nature
- [x] Implement connection lines between interacting nodes
- [x] Create temporal layer showing day progression (morning to evening)
- [x] Add cinematic auto-play mode with scene progression
- [x] Integrate sound layer with Tone.js (ambient hum, conversation tones, laptop static)
- [x] Create About page with project description
- [x] Add mode toggle between interactive and cinematic views
- [x] Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [x] Add voiceover text overlays for cinematic mode
- [x] Polish animations and transitions
- [x] Test and refine user experience

## New Features - Coffee Stain Redesign
- [x] Replace circular nodes with organic coffee stain textures
- [x] Implement proper physics-based collision detection
- [x] Add collision-triggered sound system
- [x] Create different chime sounds for same-color collisions
- [x] Create different chime sounds for cross-color collisions
- [x] Make movement more fluid and organic (liquid-like)
- [x] Add irregular watercolor-like edges to nodes
- [x] Test collision sound timing and variety

## Bug Fixes
- [ ] Fix static stains - they should be moving continuously
- [ ] Verify animation loop is running
- [ ] Check velocity application in draw loop

## New Features - Navigation
- [ ] Add left/right arrow buttons to navigate through days
- [ ] Show current day indicator (Day 1/4, Day 2/4, etc.)
- [ ] Disable left arrow on Day 1, right arrow on Day 4

## Bug Fixes

## New Features - Navigation & Color
- [x] Add left/right arrow buttons to navigate through days
- [x] Show current day indicator (Day 1/4, Day 2/4, etc.)
- [x] Improve color coding for better age group distinction
- [x] Make colors more vibrant and distinguishable
- [x] Add circular ring around isolated stains (people sitting alone)
- [x] Detect isolation based on distance from other stains

## Bug - Navigation Arrows Not Visible
- [ ] Fix arrow buttons not showing up next to day indicator
- [ ] Ensure buttons are properly styled and visible

## Content Updates
- [ ] Change title from "The Wi-Fi of Souls: A Fleeting City" to "Inside Morii - A Cup of Connection"
- [ ] Update all references throughout the site
